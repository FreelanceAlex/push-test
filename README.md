## A Git Commit & Push Test
A simple Git commit and push test. The goal of the test is to ensure successful 
configuration of SSH and the commit and push of static HTML and CSS.
## The Test Was A Success
The Git commit and push test was a success. A small hiccup occurred during the
initial terminal setup. I forgot to change the preference from HTTPS to SSH when
setting up the Git Remote within the Linux terminal. Whoops!
