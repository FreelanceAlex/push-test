## A Git Commit & Push Test
A simple Git commit and push test. The goal of the test is to ensure successful 
configuration of SSH and the commit and push of static HTML and CSS.
## The Test Was A Success
The Git commit and push test was a success. A small hiccup occurred during the
initial terminal setup. I forgot to change the preference from HTTPS to SSH when
setting up the Git Remote within the Linux terminal. Whoops!
## The Clone Test
I realized I was not yet skilled enough for Arch Linux. So I went back to GNOME. In doing so, I had to re-flash my laptop with a GNOME dist and reconfigure my developer setup.

In any event, the Git Clone work, all files were successfully cloned. We will not test a git commit & push. Fingers crossed.
